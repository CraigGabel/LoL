Used with League of Legends (LoL) game.

There are ~140 playable characters (champions) in LoL sorted into various flavors/play types/team roles.  It can be hard to remember details for each champion's role and which champions you like playing.  This is a simple GUI program that lists all champions, and allows you to create a list of champions you like.  Sorting by champion role/type is offered, as well as sorting by some simple user-provided notes.  Note that when a new champion is added to the game (or sees drastic character-defining changes), it must be manually added to the allChamps.json file.

Maybe not super useful for other people, but it's been helpful for me.

Execute program.jar to run code.

myChamps.json is where user data is saved. It is currently populated with my preferences.  You can clear/modify the file with a text editor if you want to start fresh.

You will need to install JavaFX to modify this code.

to install JavaFX in Eclipse:

1)	Go to help menu -> install new software…
2)	Top right of the window click on “add”
3)	Name is not important, but I call it “oxygen”
4)	Location is http://download.eclipse.org/releases/oxygen/
5)	Select this new repository from the drop down menu in the “install new software” window
6)	Expand “general purpose tools”
7)	Select "e(fx)lipse" (or something similar...I'm working from memory here :) )
8)	Press “next” and follow instructions to install
